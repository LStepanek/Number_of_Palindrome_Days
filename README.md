# Number_of_Palindrome_Days

Today, October 6, 2016, is considered to by a unique day since the date format in terms of "DDMMYYYY" is palindrome, i. e. sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward. Note that if the format of the day could become palindromic, then we omit the leading zero. The date format results in the term "DMMYYYY" then. How many palindrome days there were after the birth of Christ, i. e. since January 1, 0000?

After a [quick research](number_of_palindrome_days.R), we can see there were 319 palindrome days at all since January 1, 0000. What is more, there were 11 such days after January 1, 2000. In conclusion, many of us experienced 11 palindome days in total.
